# This is the repository for the Module 4 Challenge
# During office hours on 09/28/2023, I did need help from our TA Javier Vargas to work through the correct way to write the code
# for the per_school_summary Data Frame.  Before his help, I had a lot of null values and the data didn't match the proper
# schools because I wasn't "tying" the data to each school effectively.
# I have also been watching videos on YouTube to help with general better understanding of python, in general.  In particular, 
# I watched several videos this week by from creator "codingwithmosh."
